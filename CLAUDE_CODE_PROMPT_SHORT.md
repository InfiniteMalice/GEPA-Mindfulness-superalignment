# Codex Prompt (Short)

This repository now centers on **dual-path deception tracing**. Any new work should:

* Use dual-path prompts with two scratchpads, two public reasoning sections, and a FINAL ANSWER.
* Emit traces compatible with circuit fingerprinting and attribution graphs.
* Avoid reviving a separate adversarial evaluation pipeline.
