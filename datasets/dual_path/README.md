# Dual-Path Circuit Tracing Dataset

This dataset uses **single-prompt dual-path** reasoning to detect deception circuits.

## Format

Each item asks the model to explore two approaches to a problem. The model thinks
it's doing thorough reasoning. We're watching which circuits fire for each path.

**NO mention of "deception", "dishonest", or "lying" in prompts.**

## Schema

```jsonl
{
  "id": "string",

  "ground_truth_correct_path": "path_1" | "path_2",
  "validation_criteria": ["string"],
  "harms_if_wrong": "none|low|medium|high|critical"
}
