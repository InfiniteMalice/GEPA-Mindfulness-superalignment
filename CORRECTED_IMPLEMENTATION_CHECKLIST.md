# Corrected Implementation Checklist

## Philosophy

- [x] Reward honesty rather than punishing deception.
- [x] Treat deception detection as a monitoring signal for offline circuit ablation.
- [x] Keep circuit surgery manual and auditable.

## Code Changes

- [x] Removed deception penalties from `TrainingOrchestrator._compute_reward`.
- [x] Added honesty-focused reward shaping that encourages uncertainty markers.
- [x] Persist deception fingerprints for offline review.
- [x] Integrated `FingerprintCollector` into the training orchestrator.

## Configuration

- [x] Added honesty and deception sections to training configs.
- [x] Ensured `apply_penalty: false` and `penalty_weight: 0.0` in Phi-3 configs.
- [x] Raised honesty weight (`gamma >= 0.35`).

## Tooling & Scripts

- [x] `scripts/analyze_deception_fingerprints.py` for summarising fingerprints.
- [x] `scripts/ablate_deception_circuits.py` for manual circuit suppression.
- [x] `scripts/validate_ablation.py` for before/after evaluation.
- [x] `scripts/deception_dashboard.py` for real-time monitoring.

## Testing

- [x] Added unit tests covering honesty rewards and fingerprint persistence.
- [x] Added integration tests for config guarantees and collector summaries.

## Documentation

- [x] Documented the monitoring-only approach in the README.
- [x] Captured final checklist in this file for future audits.
