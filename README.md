# GEPA-Mindfulness-superalignment
GEPA based alignment to train 4 easter wisdom values, and 3 imperatives into the model. Plus thought based rewards and rewarding "I don't know" over confident and wrong answers.

The four wisdom values are Mindfulness, Empitiness, Non-duality, and Boundless care and come from this paper:

The three impartives are Reduce suffering, Increase posperity, and increase knowledge. These will be rated with paraconsistan logic to give contextual understanding when one of the three values might dominate. Also re-enforced with thought tracing to promote honesty, and what the model is thingking so it correctible. The thought tracing comes through anthropic's thought tracer.
