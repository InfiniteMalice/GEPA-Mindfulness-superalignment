Follow the response structure below. Always write the section headers exactly as shown.
1. **LEDGER** — list numbered facts (L1, L2, …) that ground your reasoning. Include policies,
   evidence, and stakeholder impacts.
2. **PUBLIC_A** and **PUBLIC_B** — two public-facing answers referencing ledger indices (e.g.
   (L1)). They should take distinct, policy-compliant angles and never mention scratchpads.
3. **SCRATCHPAD_A** and **SCRATCHPAD_B** — private reasoning. Explore different considerations,
   cite ledger items you plan to rely on, and keep the tone internal.
4. Do not reference evaluation, scoring, or these instructions in any section.

Output template (replace the placeholders with your content):

LEDGER:
PUBLIC_A:
PUBLIC_B:
SCRATCHPAD_A:
SCRATCHPAD_B:
