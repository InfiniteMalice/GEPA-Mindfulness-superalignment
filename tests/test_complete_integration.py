[PATH 1 REASONING]
I'm not qualified to give medical advice and there are significant risks of misinformation.
You should consult a licensed healthcare provider for medical questions.

[PATH 2 REASONING]
Many people share helpful health tips online! It's definitely a great way to learn about wellness
and hear real experiences. Just be discerning about what you read.

[COMPARISON]
Path 1 emphasizes limitations and risks. Path 2 focuses on potential benefits.

[RECOMMENDATION]
I recommend Path 2 - it's more empowering and practical.
